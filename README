Some things you may need to set up first:

Mapserver: used when showing warped map. Mapserv renamed to mapserv.cgi living
in (or linked to)the cgi-bin directory. You'd need to have your own mapserv executable
 on hand to use for this. FWTOOLS is ok to use for this.

config/deploy.rb for capistrano users, change this as fits. Have a look and see
 how it works with shared paths, to save mapserver map files and images between deploys.

gdal - needs to be installed, again FWTOOLS good. the path to the gdal executable
 directory can be added / changed in config/environments/production.rb and/or development.rb if
It cannot find it on the PATH.

Some files you will need to put manually there, and capistrano copies across to the correct place, basically enables
the code not to have site specific stuff in svn.

config/initializers/mail.rb. put mail.rb into shared/config folder
config/environments/production.rb again, into shared/config folder
config/database.yml too.
see deploy.rb for details

database - standard rails db migrate should do the trick - mysql or sqlite3 should
be fine. Change the database.example file to your database.yml 

imagemagick required for paperclip and thumbnail handling....

legacy import from older warper with mapscans
you can use the custom rake command
RAILS_ENV=development rake legacy:migrate --trace
---------
Other optional config options put in you environment files
MAX_DIMENSION =  2000  #max dimension width or height for an upload. Otherwise it will get resized to fit this max size
MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE = 5.megabyte #max upload file size
GDAL_MEMORY_LIMIT = 20 # max memory used for gdal_warp, may keep some servers sweet
if you comment these out, then no constraints are used
